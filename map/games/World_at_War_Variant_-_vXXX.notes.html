<br>Game engine 1.9.0.0 required.

<h2>========== KNOWN ENGINE PROBLEMS ==========

<h2>================= SPECIAL RULES SUMMARY ===================

</h2>Due that not all features are supported by the triplea engine, some rules have to be checked manually !!!
<br>
<br>---- Generally v3 rules apply, exception is that transport ships behave like normal ships as losses.
<br>
<br>--- Due that a land transport engine is not in place for triplea, landtransport has to be checked manually.
<br>Landtransport and Halftrack transport ONLY: Infantry, Paratrooper, Artillery, Defense.
<br>Train transports ALL Landunits, but only in NOT just captured territories.
<br>
<br>---- Airtransport ONLY in combat Paratrooper, in noncombat Infantry, Paratrooper, Defense, Recruit.

<br>---- Only from Landingboat amphibious attacks, Seatransport and Cruiser unload at occupied territory.
<br>Artillery, Bigarmour, Katyusha, AAGun can not attack amphibious.

<br>SBR can also be done to planes (destroy them on the ground), if they were NOT intercepting !!!
<br>
<br>---- Defense unit can not move alone, has to be transported.
<br>
<br>---- To place units you need generally a Factory AND (Vehicle OR Aircraft OR Shipyard) AND Recruits.
<br>Combat units WITH fuel need any Factory AND (Vehicle OR Aircraft OR Shipyard) AND Recruit.
<br>Combat units WITHOUT fuel need ONLY any Factory AND Recruits.
<br>NonCombat units like Landtransport, Train, Construction need any Factory and NO Recruits.
<br>
<br>---- Demolition after turn end, captureable units, e.g. Train,
<br>Vehicle, Aircraft, Shipyard, Factory, Refinery, Radar, Airbase can be destroyed.
<br>Useful at a retreat to leave nothing behind to capture.
<br>Done manually with edit.
<br>NOTE: At any time structures also from an ally can be demolished.
<br>e.g. Airbase after all allied planes have left.
<br>NOTE: In same round captured structures are NOT allowed to destroy.
<br>It makes no sense to add/remove an Oilfield with edit, its only a symbol.
<br>
<br>---- Units movement from Dover to Belgium, Lille ----:
<br>From Dover to Belgium, Lille direct connection ONLY for Airunits, to enable SBR British-Germans.
